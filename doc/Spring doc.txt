Spring
========

What is Spring?
----------------
The Spring Framework is an an open source development framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.. The framework contains many extensions like extension for building web applications.
Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promote good programming practice by enabling a
POJO-based programming model.
Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model,
it has become popular in the Java community as an alternative to, replacement for, or even addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.



Benefits
----------

Lightweight: Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of spring framework is around 2MB.

Inversion of control (IOC): Loose coupling is achieved in spring using the technique Inversion of Control. The objects give their dependencies instead of creating or looking for dependent objects.

Container: Spring contains and manages the life cycle and configuration of application objects.

Aspect oriented (AOP): Spring supports Aspect oriented programming and enables cohesive development by separating application business logic from system services.
 - In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing
 the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without
 modifying the code itself, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification,
 such as "log all function calls when the function's name begins with 'set'".


MVC Framework: Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as Struts or other over engineered or less popular web frameworks.

Transaction Management: Spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a single database, for example) and scale up to global transactions (using JTA, for example).

Exception Handling: Spring provides a convenient API to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, for example) into consistent, unchecked exceptions.
