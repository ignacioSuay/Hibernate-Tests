Creational Design Patterns
===========================
- Singleton: Create a class with a private constructor so it will only created once.

- Builder: When we need more than 3 arguments to create a class is good to create a Builder class to improve usability.

- Factory method: When we have multiple implementations for one interface and then we have one method to create one or the other depending on the configuration.

- Prototype: Create duplicate objects using Cloneable.
