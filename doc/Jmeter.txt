JMeter
=======

To Record a test
=================
In firefox:

1) go to preferences -> advanced -> network

2) click on Connection settings

3) Set manual proxy configurations: localhost 8888 (8888 is the port that you should have in the test cript recorder)


In Jmeter go to: File... -> templates -> recording and then create

To record the test just need to go to Workbench -> Http(s) scrip test recorder and click start.

 Then go to firefox and do the actions that you would like to add.


To Run a test
==============

It is better to add some listeners to the test to analyze the data.
For instance: "summary report" and "view results in a table" are very convenient.

To reproduce sign in
=====================
Some apps like jhipter sends a x-csrf token when you log in, and you cannot use the same token twice.
So in Jmeter you could use a post processor called "regular expression extractor" to extract the token from the first called
and pass it to the following calls.
